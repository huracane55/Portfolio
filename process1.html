    <h3>Process Study: Character M</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p class="intro-text">
      This illustration was a personal project intended to help me practice the application of colour theory onto a character of choice.
      To keep everything simple as to allow for myself more time to work on colouring, I opted for a straightforward standing pose with a
      standard character design.
    </p>

    <h4> Process </h4>
    <p class="content-text1">
      When starting a character illustration, I often begin with basic contours that would represent the general outline of the subject’s body.
      At this phase, the subject is simply a mannequin-like shape, devoid of any details in order to help identify any proportional miscalculations.
    </p>

        <figcaption>Figure 1: Basic contours of character</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p class="content-text2">
      Using the contour skeleton, I move onto adding details, from eyes, hair, clothing, and accessories.
      Figure 2 illustrates how the contour skeleton helps with accurately applying various details onto the model, while Figure 3 would show how the draft of the subject would appear when the skeleton is removed.
      As an added extra step, I decided to apply a set of basic colors to the draft to help visualize the subject’s color palette.
    </p>

        <figcaption>Figure 4: Colored sketch</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p class="content-text3">
      When I have determined that no significant adjustments need to be made, I start on the line art.
      Although a polished set of line art may seem intimidating with the amount of precision required, this step is very straightforward
      as my draft was made with proportions and a degree of physics in mind. Therefore, I can trace the majority of my draft, producing much cleaner lines.
      Using the color palette determined in the sketch, I apply the same coat of colors with a bit of shading to bring the subject to life, demonstrated in Figure 6.

      </figure>
    </div>

    <p class="content-text4">
      Figures 7 & 8 illustrate the iteration process after the set of base colors are applied, aiming to apply layers of details one after another to see how these details complement or conflict each other.

      </figure>
    </div>

    <p class="content-text5">
      Lastly, finishing touches are added to make the subject appear more “alive” on the canvas.

    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    <p class="ending-text">
      This personal project was a success, but not as great of a learning experience as I had originally hoped. Although i was able to produce a character without
      a unique style of colouring, in addition to blending colours together and achieving a sense of "warmth" or harmony in the image, I was unable to push my
      skills and techniques beyond my current capabilities. However, I managed to complete the illustration within my self-allotted time limit (1 week juggled with other types of work),
      which does prove that I am adequate in producing this level of work consistently in a reasonable amount of time.
