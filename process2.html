    <h3>Process Study: Character K</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p class="intro-text">
      This illustration was a personal project intended as practice for my to learn in creating artworks with an atmosphere purely through lightning and shadows, as opposed to a detailed background.
      I opted to recreate the special attack of a character that uses lightning in her attacks from video game Genshin Impact. I chose this trait as bright lights such as lightning creates a
      strong contrast between light and shadows in an image.
    </p>

    <h4> Process </h4>
    <p class="content-text1">
      As the character is the primary subject in this illustration, I begin with basic character contours to grasp a better understanding of the overall “feel” of the scene.
      I did not find a need to color the draft as the image zooms in on the character’s head. Therefore, I move onto polishing the line art and applying basic coloring.
      This section of the illustration process is relatively straightforward as most illustrations begin with these identical steps, as shown in Figures 1 – 3.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p class="content-text2">
      After the foundation is established, I decided to make a simple background that can complement the character and add a sort of mood to the picture.
      By using a dark background with a couple of brighter light streaks, I apply a prominent shadow layer on top of the character to put her into the environment,
      while highlighting certain areas of the face, hair, and body where the bright lights would hit.
      Figures 5 & 6 demonstrate the result of adding shadow and basic lighting.
    </p>

      </figure>
    </div>

    <p class="content-text3">
      To finish off the character, I went through the iterative process of working out fine details on the character until I found it acceptable.
      Figures 7 & 8 are iterations of applying detail to the character with shadows and lighting taken into account beforehand.
    </p>

        <figcaption>Figure 8: Second level of details</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p class="content-text4">
      Lastly, to compliment the unique lighting, I added a lightning effect into the foreground as the source of light.
      Hiding the character and retaining the background, I begin with simple white streaks, mimicking the behaviour of lightning, before adding blur to give the illusion of movement.
    </p>

    <div class="content-imageset">
      <figure class="content-imageset-sub">
        <img class="process-image" alt="lightning-base" src="img/process2/lightning1.png">
        <figcaption>Figure 9: Blurred lines mimicking lightning</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p class="content-text5">
      However, as lightning always has a secondary color that it fades into around the edges,
      I replicate that property by adding a layer of dark purple (in accordance to the character’s color palette) to give the lightning some dimensions.
      Finally, I add sparks and more thin lines to finish the lightning bolts.

    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    <p class="ending-text">
      This personal project was a greater success than intended. In addition to achieving a better understanding on lighting and shadows in images with a strong light source,
      I also managed to learn of a new colouring technique that essentially renders most of the tricky parts in my old method obsolete. I have been experimenting for a long
      time in search of this technique, and now I feel that I have moved one step closer in achieving my goal as a professional illustrator.
