    <h2>Bio</h2>
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am a 2D illustrator who enjoys creating artwork on various media. Primarily a digital illustrator, I began with traditional tools in 2019,
        eventually evolving my skills and knowledge in anatomy, perspective, and color theory through practicing every day.
        Creating this solid routine of everyday practice has not negatively impacted my work or motivation, but rather has helped me appreciate the art of illustration-making more than ever.
        <br>
      In addition to creating digital illustrations of original characters and fan-art of other creatorsâ€™ characters,
      I am heavily interested in character design, and am overall open to new experiences and opportunities. </p>
